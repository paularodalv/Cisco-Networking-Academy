Create an object that describes a train ticket and store it in the ticket variable. The object must have three fields:
    - starting station (key name from, give the name of the nearest station in your area as a value);
    - end station (key name to, give any other station within 100km as a value);
    - the price of the ticket (key name price, give the amount you would like to pay for this ticket as a value).
The object must be created using curly brackets, in which all created fields will be listed immediately. Then display the values of all fields of the ticket on the console. */
